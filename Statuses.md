# PebbleScript

PebbleScript uses the GNU GPLv3 License from which we have habitated to the GNU AGPLv3 License. Thus, PebbleScript will always be considered outdated although it has not reached its end of life.

# ParoLinaClient

ParolinaClient uses GNU AGPLv3 License. We have decided that we will now always use the AGPL License in every project. It is a new repository, thus, it has the AGPL License instead of the GPL License as in PebbleScript.
